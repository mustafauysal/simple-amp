  <title>About QueryPath's Testing'</title>
  <para>
    QueryPath is tested using unit tests written against the {@link PHPUnit} unit
    testing framework. Every public function of QueryPath should have at least one
    corresponding test. Most protected and private functions should also be   
    exercised, though perhaps not directly.
  </para>
  <para>
   The user guide for QueryPath is located in the 
   {@link http://fedorahosted.org/querypath official wiki}. 
   It is kept updated with all of the latest information.
